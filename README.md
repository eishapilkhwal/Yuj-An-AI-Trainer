# YUJ
**YUJ** is the **next generation** **AI Yoga Trainer**. Yuj is a Trainer who helps you, sees you and tells you whether you are doing yoga poses correctly or not. And a Trainer who is available every-time  anywhere. It predicts what pose you are making and How you are making it in real time. Basically, It predicts where the different parts of the body are present in the image and uses this data to predict the pose. If you are doing the pose correctly then the timer will start and in case you did any mistake then the timer will restart.
